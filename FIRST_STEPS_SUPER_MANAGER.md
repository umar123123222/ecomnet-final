## Critical Understanding Points

### ✅ Automatic Inventory Updates
**You never manually update inventory.** The system handles it automatically:

1. **GRN Acceptance** → Stock added to warehouse
2. **Order Creation** → Stock reserved (not deducted)
3. **Order Dispatch** → Stock deducted from outlet
4. **Return Received** → Stock added back to outlet
5. **Stock Transfer "In Transit"** → Stock leaves source outlet
6. **Stock Transfer Completion** → Stock arrives at destination

### 📊 Key Metrics You Own
- **Purchase Order Accuracy:** % of POs received without major variances
- **Stock-out Rate:** % of time outlets run out of key products
- **Order Fulfillment Time:** Average time from order to dispatch
- **Return Rate:** % of orders returned
- **Fraud Detection Rate:** % of fraudulent orders caught
- **Inventory Turnover:** How quickly stock sells

### 🚨 Escalation Criteria
**When to escalate to Super Admin:**
- Major supplier quality issues affecting multiple POs
- System bugs or integration failures
- Repeated fraud patterns requiring rule changes
- Staff access issues or permission changes needed
- Major variances (>10% of PO value)
